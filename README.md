Notes from Wed 2/11 Class meeting:

** Oxygen may no longer be an option!
Partial pressure of CO2 may work as an alternative
salinity may also work (check to see if SHR emits brine)
conductivity could work

Fluorometer for fidoplankton activity (David will look at this)

Check to see how o2 varies throughout all time to see if pattern emerges despite low overall o2 (Michael's on it)

** Data processing discussion
We will store output CSV files and assuming we don't run out of space original data files of whatever types on the shared onedrive

**Plan for producing training data
Pull out mean, max, and min from sonar data
Reprocess seismic data (three components, x, y, z) to 1 hour chunks with mean max min amplitude, 1st dominant frquency and spectral power associated with that frequency.
Use tidal data to denoise other data

Plan to do all this by next Thursday's meeting.
