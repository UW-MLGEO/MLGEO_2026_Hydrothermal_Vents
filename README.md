I used gemini to generate a script which uses the

mass spec data (that I had to manually download

because OOI is tough to use)

The data is faw so I had to rely entirely on the

ai to know what to do with it.

I then had it generate a plot of the whole year

in 1 hr increments, many of which are likely empty

because the data seemed to only record for a few

hours at a time on the days when it had power.

I used UV to track dependencies and only uploaded

the ai generated files that actually worked for me.

If you choose to use them you will have to change

some of the folder paths.
