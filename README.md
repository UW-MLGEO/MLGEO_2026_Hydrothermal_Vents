** Data processing discussion
We will store output CSV files and assuming we don't run out of space original data files of whatever types on the shared onedrive

** Plan for producing training data
Pull out mean, max, and min from sonar data
Reprocess seismic data (three components, x, y, z) to 1 hour chunks with mean max min amplitude, 1st dominant frquency and spectral power associated with that frequency.
Use tidal data to denoise other data

Plan to do all this by next Thursday's meeting.
